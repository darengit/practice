practice
========

I often make simple use of assert in java, when attempting to run a class use "java -ea" -ea means "enable asserts".

The classes with main() that can be executed on jvm usually have all other classes it needs in the same directory. In some cases I make use of classes in practice/util directory, include that directory in class path when compiling and jvm'ing.
