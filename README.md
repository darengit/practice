Projects Ongoing
================

This is a collection of micro and small projects in C and C++ for Linux. I unfortunately don't
currently have the expertise or time to make them work on other OS, not even OS X.  >.<

I unfortunately also don't currently have the resources to carry any of these ideas any further
and as a result the code is not presentable enough to anyone other than myself, the author.

These projects are cool examples that are educational and fun to look at more than anything
else. They should each have README.md as well as makefile. Getting more fluent with makefiles
is on my list of areas of improvement.

scratchwork is a directory with a hodgepodge of stuff that is meaningless to anyone else.
