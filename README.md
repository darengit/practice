Projects Ongoing
================

This is a collection of micro and small projects in C and C++ for Linux. I unfortunately don't
currently have the expertise or time to make them work on other OS, not even OS X.  >.<

These projects are cool examples that are educational and fun to look at more than anything
else. They should reach have README.md as well as makefile. Getting more fluent with makefiles
is on my list of areas of improvement.

scratchwork is a directory with a hodgepodge of stuff that is meaningless to anyone else.
